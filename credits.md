## Acknowledgments

As many open source projects, Ed is the work of community. The project starts with the open web, and everything in between leading to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the wonderful team who wrangled that Ruby in our favor. The theme stylesheets are built on top of [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), a Jekyll theme based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), "the Jekyll butler," both created by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo) and distributed with an MIT license. Thanks, Mark, for your helpful streamlining! Special hat tips to brother-in-markdown-arms, [Chris Forster](https://github.com/c-forster), and the generous [Sylvester Keil](https://github.com/inukshuk/) for his work on Jekyll Scholar.


We are strongly indebted to the research work and conversations stemming out of our [Columbia's Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/)—or as we like to call it: #xpmethod; the wonderful international comradery of [GO::DH](http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/); and of course, the support of our [Columbia University Libraries](http://library.columbia.edu/) and its cozy [Studio@Butler](https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/).

...and to the writers that inspire us to scribble notes on the margins we protect with our work. Thank you.
